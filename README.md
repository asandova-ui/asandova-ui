### üß± 42 Projects
[`42-CURSUS`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS)
#### üß© Foundations (C, Unix, Algorithms)
- [`libft`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS/tree/main/42-CURSUS/Libft): A foundational C library where I recreated standard C functions (e.g., `memcpy`, `atoi`, `strdup`) plus extended utilities for memory and string manipulation, list operations, and more. Deepens knowledge of data structures, memory handling, and algorithms.
- [`printf`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS/tree/main/42-CURSUS/printf): Custom implementation of `printf`, requiring complex format string parsing and management of variadic arguments. Reinforced skills in string parsing and formatting.
- [`gnl`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS/tree/main/42-CURSUS/get_next_line): Function to read a line from a file descriptor, supporting multiple FDs without losing state. Highlights dynamic memory, buffer control, and I/O.
- [`push_swap`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS/tree/main/42-CURSUS/push_swap): Sorting algorithm challenge using two stacks (`a` and `b`) and limited operations to output the minimal sequence of moves. Covers algorithm design, error handling, and performance optimization.

#### üñºÔ∏è Graphics & Game Dev
- [`so_long`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS/tree/main/42-CURSUS/so_long): Simple 2D game built with MiniLibX, featuring pathfinding and map parsing.
- [`Cub3d`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS/tree/main/42-CURSUS/cub3d): Raycasting 3D engine in C with textures, animated sprites, minimap, and mouse-controlled camera.

#### üíª Systems Programming
- [`pipex`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS/tree/main/42-CURSUS/pipex): Recreates shell behavior with pipelines and redirections, including `here_doc` capabilities.
- [`philosophers`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS/tree/main/42-CURSUS/philosophers): Simulates the Dining Philosophers problem using multithreading (`pthreads`) with emphasis on concurrency and resource synchronization.
- [`minishell`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS/tree/main/42-CURSUS/minishell): Mini Unix shell featuring command parsing, built-ins, redirections, job control, and fork-based execution.

#### üß™ C++ Object-Oriented Programming
[`Cpp Modules`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS/tree/main/42-CURSUS/CPP)
- [`Cpp Modules 00‚Äì04`]: Introduces OOP basics: constructors, canonical form, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- [`Cpp Modules 05‚Äì09`]: Deepens C++ with casting, exceptions, templates, and standard containers like `std::vector` and `map`.

#### üåê Networking & DevOps
- [`ft?irc`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS/tree/main/42-CURSUS/ft_irc): An Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server written in C++98, fully compliant with the RFC 1459 standard. It supports multiple clients, private/public channels, operators, and real-time message broadcasting. The project emphasizes network programming, concurrency management with `select()`, and building scalable communication protocols.
- [`Inception`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS/tree/main/42-CURSUS/inception): Docker-based multi-container setup using NGINX, WordPress, MariaDB, TLS, and secrets to simulate infrastructure deployment.

### üí° About Me  

I am a curious and versatile engineer with a background in Telecommunications (UVA) and current studies at 42 Madrid. My interests span across many areas of technology, from low-level programming and operating system internals to networking, backend engineering, and distributed systems. I enjoy working with Linux environments and languages such as C, C++, Python, and Java, as well as tools like Docker and Flask, applying them to projects that range from algorithmic libraries to scalable servers. I see software as a way to understand how complex systems interact, and I am motivated by the challenge of designing solutions that are both efficient and reliable. At the moment, I am exploring advanced C++ design patterns, cloud infrastructure, and the principles of large-scale system architecture.
