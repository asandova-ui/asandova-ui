## 👨‍🎓 About Me

I’m always looking to **improve and expand my knowledge**.  
I have strong skills in **systems, computer science, networking, software design, telecommunications, embedded systems, and digital signal processing**.  

At **42 Madrid**, I have worked on demanding projects that strengthened my abilities in **algorithmic thinking, teamwork, and low-level programming**.  
As a **Telecom Engineer (UVA)**, I gained a solid foundation in **communications, network protocols, system architecture, and software development**.

### 🧱 42 Projects
[`42-CURSUS`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS)
#### 🧩 Foundations (C, Unix, Algorithms)
- [`libft`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS/tree/main/42-CURSUS/Libft): A foundational C library where I recreated standard C functions (e.g., `memcpy`, `atoi`, `strdup`) plus extended utilities for memory and string manipulation, list operations, and more. Deepens knowledge of data structures, memory handling, and algorithms.
- [`printf`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS/tree/main/42-CURSUS/printf): Custom implementation of `printf`, requiring complex format string parsing and management of variadic arguments. Reinforced skills in string parsing and formatting.
- [`gnl`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS/tree/main/42-CURSUS/get_next_line): Function to read a line from a file descriptor, supporting multiple FDs without losing state. Highlights dynamic memory, buffer control, and I/O.
- [`push_swap`](https://github.com/asandova-ui/42-CURSUS/tree/main/42-CURSUS/push_swap): Sorting algorithm challenge using two stacks (`a` and `b`) and limited operations to output the minimal sequence of moves. Covers algorithm design, error handling, and performance optimization.

#### 🖼️ Graphics & Game Dev
- [`so_long`](https://github.com/TU_USUARIO/so_long): Simple 2D game built with MiniLibX, featuring pathfinding and map parsing.
- [`Cub3d`](https://github.com/TU_USUARIO/Cub3d): Raycasting 3D engine in C with textures, animated sprites, minimap, and mouse-controlled camera.

#### 💻 Systems Programming
- [`pipex`](https://github.com/TU_USUARIO/pipex): Shell-like pipeline manager handling redirections and `here_doc`.
- [`philosophers`](https://github.com/TU_USUARIO/philosophers): Multithreading challenge simulating the dining philosophers problem with pthreads.
- [`minishell`](https://github.com/TU_USUARIO/minishell): Fully functioning Unix shell with parsing, built-ins, redirections, and job control.

#### 🧪 C++ Object-Oriented Programming
- [`Cpp Modules 00–04`](https://github.com/TU_USUARIO/Cpp00-04): Basics of OOP, constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- [`Cpp Modules 05–09`](https://github.com/TU_USUARIO/Cpp05-09): Advanced C++ topics: casting, exceptions, templates, STL containers.

#### 🌐 Networking & DevOps
- [`webserv`](https://github.com/TU_USUARIO/webserv): HTTP/1.1 server in C++ with CGI, file uploads, custom error pages, and concurrency via `poll()`.
- [`Inception`](https://github.com/TU_USUARIO/Inception): Docker-based project setting up NGINX, WordPress, MariaDB with TLS, secrets, and isolated containers.
